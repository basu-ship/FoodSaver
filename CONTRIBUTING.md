## 🌿 Branch Naming Guidelines

Keep branch names descriptive and prefixed correctly:

- **Features:** `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/add-recipe-search`)  
- **Bug Fixes:** `fix/<short-description>` (e.g., `fix/login-button-alignment`)  
- **Documentation:** `docs/<short-description>` (e.g., `docs/update-install-guide`)  
- **Hotfixes:** `hotfix/<short-description>` (e.g., `hotfix/critical-db-error`)

## 📝 Code Style

Consistency is key! Please follow these guidelines:

- **Indentation:** Use consistent indentation (check existing project files for 2 or 4 spaces).  
- **Naming:** Use `camelCase` for variables and functions in JavaScript/React.  
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, descriptive messages summarizing the change.  
- **Comments:** Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

## 📨 Pull Requests

Make the reviewer's job easy:

- **Target:** Ensure your PR is targeted to the correct branch (`main` or `develop`).  
- **Description:** Include a clear description of your changes.  
- **Screenshots:** Add screenshots or GIFs if UI changes are made.  
- **Scope:** Avoid including unrelated changes. Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
